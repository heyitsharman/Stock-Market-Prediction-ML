-This project focuses on predicting stock prices using the Linear Regression machine learning algorithm. Historical stock market data is used to analyze price trends and identify relationships between different features such as opening price, closing price, volume, and market behavior.

-The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and improve model performance through feature scaling. 

-The model is trained and evaluated using Scikit-learn, with performance measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.

-Visualizations are generated to compare actual and predicted stock prices, helping to better understand the model’s accuracy.

-The project is implemented using Python along with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook, and serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to applying machine learning techniques in financial data analysis.
